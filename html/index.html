            <p>My name is Ril (or Rillo, whatever you like better) and I live in Bavaria, Germany. I am currently
                <span>23 years
                    old</span> and I was technically doing tech stuff since I was 7. Since then I was fascinated by
                computers and was always curious of how they worked. I could never make thought of how they even did
                something simple like basic math. This curiosity never really faded and so, I have set my goal to
                learn as much about computers as I can.
            </p>
            <p>With such curiosity I have worked with several technologies just to understand how they work and how
                I can use them to solve problems in Informationprocessing as also how I can make computers and
                everything that makes a beep do whatever I want.</p>
            <p>I like fast hard Techno Music and everything that makes weird sounds, danceable or not. You can follow my
                DJ Profile on Instagram: @djprismflux. Also be sure to checkout the Instagram page of our collective:
                @dirol_collective</p>

            <p>I am also a fun person to hangout with I've heard :D<sub>[Citation needed]</sub></p>

            <p>I am experimenting with the gemini-protocol and have setup a example geminilog instance at <a
                    href="geminini://cyberpsych0si.is/">geminini://gemini.cyberpsych0si.is</a>.</p>
            However, it is not done right now but you are free to visit it. I also wrote a <a
                href="https://gemini.cyberpsych0si.is/">
                https proxy</a></p>

            <p>You are maybe asking why I have two web pages or why there was another page here before.</p>
            <p>Well, I can answer that. I felt my old page was too overpowered for the culture. I've used many
                javascripts and tried to pull some really nice tricks, but I felt it was kinda pointless.</p>
            <p>Seeing how much easier it can be I was thinking that I'm approaching this in the wrong way. So I created
                this page which is only based on HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>Also I plan to pull the plug for cloudflare by pulling the plug for it. Since I'm also trying to host
                this page on my own hardware, I have to find out how I can use this with a dynamic IP address. Its a lot
                more complicated than I thought at the start...</p>
